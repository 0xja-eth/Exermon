Well-designed workplaces often create environments that make employees better thinkers. So today, I’ll talk about how to design workplaces that inspire creativity. I hope you can find it useful. First, the colour of the office walls. Decorate your office with green. Other bright colours such as light blue and yellow can also increase creativity. Calmer colours help us concentrate. Green also reminds us of nature, which may help us to relax. Avoid red when you are choosing a colour. While it can give us a feeling of energy, it also affects our ability to analyze information. Then, let’s turn to lighting. Lighting is also important. Too dark, and workers can feel sleepy. While, if it is too bright, it can make them feel anxious. The best kind of lighting is natural light. It makes us happier and more productive. When it comes toartificial lighting, warm colours are the best. But if we need to concentrate, a bluer light is better. Space is another important matter. A company might want to develop a variety of spaces in an office so staff can find privacy if needed, but also work in open areas for creative thinking.",

I\u2019m very glad to be here to talk to you. People need to feel secure and comfortable so they can be creative. Well-designed workplaces often create environments that make employees better thinkers. So today, I\u2019ll talk about how to design workplaces that inspire creativity. I hope you can find it useful. First, the colour of the office walls. Decorate your office with green. Other bright colours such as light blue and yellow can also increase creativity. Calmer colours help us concentrate. Green also reminds us of nature, which may help us to relax. Avoid red when you are choosing a colour. While it can give us a feeling of energy, it also affects our ability to analyze information. Then, let\u2019s turn to lighting. Lighting is also important. Too dark, and workers can feel sleepy. While, if it is too bright, it can make them feel anxious. The best kind of lighting is natural light. It makes us happier and more productive. When it comes toartificial lighting, warm colours are the best. But if we need to concentrate, a bluer light is better. Space is another important matter. A company might want to develop a variety of spaces in an office so staff can find privacy if needed, but also work in open areas for creative thinking.", "questions": [{"title": "Which colour is unsuitable for office walls?", "answers": ["Green.", "Red.", "Yellow."], "option": 2}, {"title": "What effect does natural light have on office workers?", "answers": ["It is good for their eyes.", "It helps them concentrate.", "It makes them feel cheerful."], "option": 3}, {"title": "Who are most likely to be interested in the talk?", "answers": ["Managers.", "Painters.", "Teachers."], "option": 1}]}]}, {"groupQuestions": [{"audio": "audios/2.1.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "What is the weather like?", "answers": ["It\u2019s raining.", "It\u2019s cloudy.", "It\u2019s sunny."], "option": 2}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.2.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "Who will go to China next month?", "answers": ["Lucy.", "Alice.", "Richard."], "option": 1}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.3.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "What are the speakers talking about?", "answers": ["The man\u2019s sister.", "A film.", "An actor."], "option": 3}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.4.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "Where will the speakers meet?", "answers": ["In Room 340.", "In Room 314.", "In Room 223."], "option": 1}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.5.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "Where does the conversation most probably take place?", "answers": ["In a restaurant.", "In an office.", "At home."], "option": 2}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.6.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "Why did the woman go to New York?", "answers": ["To spend some time with the baby.", "To look after her sister.", "To find a new job."], "option": 1}, {"title": "How old was the baby when the woman left New York?", "answers": ["Two months.", "Five months.", "Seven months."], "option": 3}, {"title": "What did the woman like doing most with the baby?", "answers": ["Holding him.", "Playing with him.", "Feeding him."], "option": 3}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.7.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "What are the speakers talking about?", "answers": ["A way to improve air quality.", "A problem with traffic miles.", "A suggestion for city planning."], "option": 1}, {"title": "What does the man suggest?", "answers": ["Limiting the use of cars.", "Encouraging people to walk.", "Warning drivers of air pollution."], "option": 1}, {"title": "What does the woman think about the man\u2019s idea?", "answers": ["It\u2019s interesting.", "It\u2019s worth trying.", "It\u2019s impractical."], "option": 3}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.8.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "How long will the man probably stay in New Zealand?", "answers": ["One week.", "Two weeks.", "Three weeks."], "option": 3}, {"title": "What advice does the woman give to the man?", "answers": ["Go to New Zealand after Christmas.", "Book his flight as soon as possible.", "Save more money for his trip."], "option": 2}, {"title": "What can we learn about flights to New Zealand at Christmas time?[", "answers": ["They require early booking.", "They can be twice as expensive.", "They are on special offer."], "option": 2}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.9.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "Why did Jane call Mike?", "answers": ["To ask him to meet her.", "To tell him about Tom.", "To borrow his car."], "option": 3}, {"title": "Where will Jane be in about one hour?", "answers": ["At Mike\u2019s place.", "At the airport.", "At a garage."], "option": 1}, {"title": "What can we infer from the conversation?", "answers": ["Jane has just learned to drive.", "Jane\u2019s car is in bad condition.", "Mike will go to the airport."], "option": 2}]}, {"audio": "audios/2.10.mp3", "article": "", "questions": [{"title": "What did the speaker ask the students to do the week before?", "answers": ["Write a short story.", "Prepare for the lesson.", "Learn more about the writer."], "option": 2}, {"title": "Why does the speaker ask the questions?", "answers": ["To check the students\u2019 understanding of the story.", "To draw the students\u2019 attention to reading skills.", "To let the students discuss father-son relationships."], "option": 1}, {"title": "What will the students do in 10 minutes?", "answers": ["Ask more questions.", "Discussion in groups.", "Give their answers."], "option": 3}]}]}]
